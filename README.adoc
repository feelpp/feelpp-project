This repository provides a basic starting point for a {feelpp} application including:

- [x] {cpp} code
- [x] documentation using asciidoc and antora
- [x] continuous integration including tests
- [x] docker image generation and delivery

== Release process

- [x] update the version in CMakeLists.txt
- [x] update the version in docs/antora.yml
- [x] commit the changes with the message "Release vx.y.z". At this point the CI will generate the docker image and push it to docker hub
