A template repository to kickstart your finite-element applications with Feel++.

== Features

* **C++** example apps using Feel++ and its toolboxes (located in `src/`).
* **Python** Jupyter notebooks under `docs/notebooks/` for interactive demos.
* **Documentation** authored in AsciiDoc and published with Antora (`docs/`).
* **Docker** setup for reproducible development and deployment.
* **CI** via GitHub Actions: C++ tests, Python wheel builds, docs site.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

* CMake ≥ 3.21  
* A C++ compiler (GCC or Clang) with MPI support  
* Python 3.8+ and `pip`  
* Docker (optional, for container builds)

=== Clone & Rename

If you used this as a template, rename the project metadata:
[source,bash]
----
./rename.sh your-project-name
----

NOTE: After renaming, verify URLs in `docs/site.yml` and `docs/package.json`.

== Building

=== CMake Presets

Create **CMakePresets.json** in your project root or update the one provided:

[source,bash]
----
cmake --preset default
cmake --build --preset default
cmake --build --preset default --target install
----

`build/default` will contain the build artifacts and the build directory.

== Continuous Integration

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes:

* build_wheel: Python wheel compilation and artifact upload.
* docs: Builds the Antora site, deploys to GitHub Pages on master.
* build_code: CMake build, tests with ctest --preset default, packaging.
* deliver: Docker image build & push to GHCR.
* release: On tags vX.Y.Z, publishes binaries, wheels, datasets, and creates a GitHub release.

== Versioning & Release

Project version is centrally defined in:

* CMakeLists.txt
* docs/antora.yml
* docs/package.json

=== Release Process

.	Bump the version in the three files above.
.	Commit with:
+
 $ git commit -am "Release vX.Y.Z"
+
. Tag and push:
+
 $ git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags
+
. GitHub Actions will build and publish artifacts automatically.

== Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

* Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
* Adhere to existing coding conventions; add C++ tests where appropriate.
* Update documentation (docs/) for any new features.
* Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
